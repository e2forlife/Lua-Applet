# Applet Scripts

This folder contains the scripts used for the applet, and it also includes expansion frameworks and libraries (`scripts/modules`) that can be used in `require` statements to load external scripts.  The `scripts/utilities` folder contains the build utilities used to compile the Lua to C code and other functions used by the applet framework in the project.
